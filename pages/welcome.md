# Introduction to the project

## Welcome!

How does one come to dedicate an entire website, which first has to be built as well, enhanced by an endlessly seeming blog, to the digitalisation of 13 buddhist objects coming from the ancient region of Gandhara in Pakistan, standing in an museum in the small city of Werl in Germany which is currently closed anyways?

The answer is, that a bachelor student, I, Melissa Rogalski is doing their first research project, combining researching about building their own website to portray photographed objects, and researching about Gandhara, the region which is rich of culture because of its buddhist heritage as well combined with dealing with missionary and colonial museums.

As a result, this website contains the pictures of these now digitalised objects which I took in the museum in Werl, and further information about those as I tried to find out where these objects came from. To link to that, I also explored the history of the museum in Werl, as also about german mission museums generally, for exmple dealing with provenance research. To also connect to the objects themselves, I included research about the region of Gandhara, its history and its buddhist past. Other chapters include smaller topics which seemes either necessary or interesting to include.

To look back on, I also wrote about the whole process of this project, as it took time during the entire summer semester of 2023, and now in October 2023 the result of this entire research has been published through this website.
## Enjoy!
