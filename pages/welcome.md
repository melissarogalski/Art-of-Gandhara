# Introduction to the project

## Welcome!

How does one go about dedicating an entire website to the digitalization of thirteen Buddhist objects originating from the ancient region of Gandhara in Pakistan? Especially objects which currently reside in a museum in the small city of Werl, Germany, which is presently closed. 

The answer lies in the efforts of a bachelor student, Melissa Rogalski —myself— embarking on their initial research project. This project involves the dual focus of creating a website to showcase photographed objects and delving into the rich cultural heritage of Gandhara, with its significant Buddhist influence. Simultaneously, I address the complexities associated with missionary and colonial museums.

As a result, this website features digitalized images of the objects taken during my visit to the closed mission museum in Werl. Additionally, it provides in-depth information about these artifacts, including my attempts to trace their origins. I also delve into the history of the Werl museum and German mission museums at large, with an emphasis on provenance research. To further contextualize the objects, I explore the history of Gandhara, especially its important Buddhist past. The website additionally includes smaller topics deemed either necessary or interesting to complete my research.

To look back on this project, I document the process undertaken throughout the summer semester of 2023. Now, in October 2023, the result of this research project has been presented through the publication of this website.

#Enjoy exploring!
