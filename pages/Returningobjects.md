# Returning the objects to Gandhara? The future of museum collections from colonial times
Already having written about the history of missionary museums, it is also important to investigate theim today critically, especially how they should handle their collections and responsibilities of owing those objects in the future. 

Therefore the question emerges, if those museums, and also the museum in Werl with missionary objects and the Gandharan objects, should return those objects from the colonial period back to their country of origin, and generally how the future of such museums and collections ideally should look like. 

The following chapters serve to dive deeper into this topic, both regarding mission and colonial museum collections generally, but also the museum in Werl specially. 

## The problem with colonial objects 
Before talking about returning objects, it’s important to notice why these objects even are difficult to handle: as priory mentioned, the museums mostly got their objects from suspect and not always legal interactions. 

While, more obviously it is in the case of the gandharan objects here, not every object has been stolen and purchased under violence, war or blackmailing, still most of the objects in colonial, ethnographic or missionary museums were acquired under colonial power relations in which the person or the “Herkunftsgesellschaft” who originally owned the objects was disadvantaged of power and the choice to freely decide over their belonging. 

Even in case of the gandharan objects, it isn’t exactly clear if this trade for whiskey was even an legal transaction. 

Therefore, almost all of the objects in those collections are a proof of how objects were collected, or in the case of pictures as they are hanging in the entire collection, even produced, to show of the people from colonial areas and their cultures, which were seen as inferior to western culture. 

Another important problem which museums are facing today, is the lack of documentation of those objects, which again also can be seen as a lack of respect towards those cultures. It also comes from the fact, that not only ethnologists, but also missionaries, travellers, colonial officers and people who only wanted to gain money were collection and donating objects to the museums, and therefore didn’t empathise on documenting information about the purchase and the object generally. The Forum der Völker with mainly missionaries collecting, and with Ernst Majonica, a politician who purchased the gandharan objects, therefore serves as the best example of this problem, and the further struggle of this has been discussed before in the chapter about provenance research.

Another important topic is the lack of understanding from the western culture about the culture of origin. For example, museums owning human remains only pay attention to the European laws about dealing with the death, while it’s sometimes completely different in the cultures the bodies and remains were taken from, which leads to disrespecting the beliefs of those cultures.

While in Germany for example, it’s totally acceptable (after a certain time has passed) to use skeletons and human remains either donated or taken from graves for scientific research or for educational purposes to be portrayed in museums and exhibitions. In other cultures however, it is seen as disrespectful towards the death person to use them for commercial purposes, and the same even applies to ritual and holy objects. Therefore, the museums and collections don’t respect the values of the non-western cultures.

Concluded, the museums have to face the problem if their objects were being stolen, if their purchase has been a result of oppression and violence, the fact that most of them are result of colonial oppression and that they were serving to degrade those cultures and present the West as superior, and additionally that holy or ritual objects are disrespected of their value which they might hold for the rightful owners, but also the lack of documentation as a result of the listed factors above.

## Restitution
How are museums today supposed to handle the problems listed above? 

The restitution of colonial objects isn’t something which only has been discussed now, but there’s been discussions going on for several years now. While Germany knowingly has been doing provenance research of stolen objects from the third reich to return them to their rightful owners, that isn’t exactly the goal researching about colonial objects for different reasons, with scholars having different opinions about it. 

Some people claim, that every single objects which came to those museums under colonial conditions with asymmetrical power relations is something that should be returned to its country of origin. 

Others say, that only some of these objects count as objects that should be discussed critically to possibly be returned, namely only those who provably have been acquired illegally. 

Most scholars represent the opinion, that not every singe objects has to be returned. Everyday objects aren’t as important to be returned as ritual or holy objects, which still possibly hold a meaning to the culture or ancestors of who it was taken from. 
Almost most important it is to return humanly remains, especially skeletons or bones taken from graves, as the reasons for this have been discussed in the prior chapter.

But why is it harder to possibly return these colonial objects than objects in the Third Reich for example? 

First, as already mentioned before, a lot of objects don’t have a good documentation and therefore it’s simply not clear where they come from, and it’s harder to do research about that just now since a lot more time has passed since then. Some even say, that restitution isn’t necessary today, since the damage of taking these objects, either legal or under force, isn’t present today anymore after generations have passed, while other scholars claim that this is not true and that the damage done to the cultures are still being present today. 
The moral perspective therefore isn’t something everyone agrees over, but not even the legal perspective isn’t clear. 
While some countries have defined laws about how museums should handle their objects, Germany hasn’t come that far yet. In Germany, a object has to fulfil certain conditions to be returned. 

First, it has to be exactly defined where the object comes from by proofs. Secondly, also the rightful owner has to proof the ownership, but how are the owners supposed to proof something which was that long ago and something that even has been robbed or blackmailed as it has been in many cases? If the proofing isn’t possible, the museum has the last word over the decision, not having to follow national guidelines, as it’s the case in other countries where they have national laws or special local offices to decide over that, and that definitely seems like something which has to be rethinked in Germany.

## Future of post-colonial museums
Now having mentioned all of the above problems, the question is how colonial- ethnographic- and mission museums should proceed in the future. 

First it seems obvious that museums have to restrain from their previously portraying of non-western cultures in a inferior way, but there has to be a new positioning of the aim of the exhibition, if they haven’t already done that. 

One can even ask if those museums even are of relevance today, and if yes it is suggested that they should portray their objects in a neutral way without putting stereotypes as being exotic or wild on them. 

Another chance for the museums would be to actually include indigenous people in the rebuilding of exhibitions, so not only the portraying of the objects will be decolonized, but also the structure of those museums. Therefore, a chance might be to not let westerners alone decide about the fate of the museums objects, but to get in contacts with the “Herkunftsgesellschaften”, which of course can can be hard if the provenance of objects is unclear. Still, it’s important to not fall back into the old colonial power structures, if only the western museums are in charge.

So in the end, post-ethnographic museums have to chance to change from places to portray objects as representatives for cultures, but instead become a room to interact and engage with those without the already imprinted image by the western curators. It’s a process which takes time, especially in the case of the Forum der Völker, since the museums currently doesn’t have the capacity for a possible change.
