# Missionary museums: A Historical Perspective

The history of missionary museums and collections in Germany dates back to the colonial era. This period witnessed not only the colonisation of overseas regions by Europeans but also the presence of missionaries sent by the Catholic and Protestant churches. These missionaries had a dual objective: to spread Christianity among the native populations and to collect ethnological objects from these regions. These objects were then transported back to Germany, where numerous museums were established during the 19th century to house them.

Originally, these collections served as preparation tools for future missionaries, helping them to familiarise themselves with the cultures they would encounter. However, it soon became evident that these ethnological artefacts held a broader appeal and were of significant interest to the general public. Today, Germany still has approximately 80 of such museums, although many of them are relatively small and located within monasteries.

Unfortunately, much of the valuable context and information about these objects was not adequately documented at the time of their collection. Consequently, a significant portion of these artefacts remains shrouded in mystery within museum collections. Many individuals and organisations are advocating for these museums to engage in thorough provincial research to rectify historical injustices done by the activities of the missionaries, which often included the appropriation and mishandling of sacred and sacrificial objects by relocating them to Germany for public display. However, a more detailed discussion of these issues will follow later in this discourse.

## Franciscans and their missionary work
To gain a better understanding of the museum's composition, let's delve into the role of the Franciscans, particularly the Franciscan missionaries who played a pivotal role in its establishment. These missionaries followed a distinct branch of Catholicism, stemming from the thirteenth-century Italian reform movement initiated by St. Francis of Assisi. This movement centered on principles that emphasised caring for the impoverished and marginalised, promoting fraternity, embracing a life of poverty supported by alms, and dedicating one's existence to the church through an ascetic lifestyle. Despite the stringent nature of these rules, the Franciscan movement gained widespread popularity and played a significant role in religious reform in late medieval Europe.

However, in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the priorities of the Franciscans shifted toward the goal of Christian conversion, particularly in non-European regions. These early Franciscan missionaries were often celebrated as courageous individuals who ventured into untamed territories, sacrificing themselves to spread Christianity among indigenous populations. They perceived the waning religiosity in Western Europe as an opportunity to establish Christianity in far-flung lands where pagan religions prevailed. Nevertheless, their motivations were not purely altruistic. In addition to spreading Christianity, they aimed to impose what they viewed as European civilization on cultures and religions they considered uncivilised.

Their efforts included practices like dressing indigenous peoples in European-style clothing and providing Western education through missionary schools. In doing so, they often marginalised indigenous knowledge, replacing traditional shamanic practices with Western medicine, believing it to represent progress and civilization.

The first official organisation of the German mission was the "Franziskaner-Missions-Verein," founded in 1907 in Werl, just two years before the inauguration of the museum's first collection. This organisation, led by the Franciscan Wenzelaus Strausfeld OFM, initially focused on constructing and maintaining the Franciscan Shangdong mission in China, with the primary aim of converting the Chinese people to Christianity. When they were expelled from China in 1948, they redirected their efforts to Japan and Brasilia, where they established a new Franciscan mission organisation in 1951. Their primary mission shifted after World War II, focusing on aiding the impoverished and oppressed, combating hunger and starvation, and engaging with and learning from diverse cultures and peoples.

Today, they initiate and support projects not only in China but also in Northeast Brazil, East Africa, and Vietnam.

## Forum der Völker in Werl
The Forum der Völker Museum, located in Werl, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, is a museum collection with its origins in the Franciscan Abbey.

Established in 1909 in Dorsten, the museum was reconstructed in 1962 after being destroyed during World War II. It was later relocated to Werl and currently houses a collection of over fitfteen-thousand objects from outside the European continent (6.300 from the colonial context, 3.400 coins), including art and artefacts from East Asia, Africa, the Americas, Oceania, and the Middle East, all displayed across more than 1,000 square meters of exhibition space. 

These objects were collected by about 95 missionaries and sisters and 16 monasteries or church institutions, or in some cases were purchased or donated by private collectors as Ernst Majonica, who brought the objects from Gandhara to Germany. 

Despite undergoing multiple renovations and reorganisations since 1987, the museum is currently closed due to various reasons, mainly due to financial constraints.

## Museum’s Foundation and Historical Background 
Previously known as a Missionary Museum, the museum was later rebranded as Forum der Völker. However, the original name already indicated that the objects primarily came from Franciscan monks who gathered them during their missionary activities across various regions to promote Christianity in Germany. These dedicated monks collected a wide array of everyday and ritual objects to provide insight into their missionary work. The museum asserted that the Franciscan monks were continuing a medieval tradition of collecting and depicting foreign cultures, viewing it as their duty to make these objects publicly accessible, especially in the region of Dorsten during that era.

The initial museum was established in an old section of the Dorsten monastery and focused exclusively on the Orient, East Asia, and the Americas. The first objects primarily originated from monks on their missionary missions who either sent or brought these items back. Private collectors also contributed, and their contributions are duly acknowledged in the museum's official 1987 catalog. It is mentioned that these individuals played an important role in preserving and maintaining the core of the collection, potentially preventing its destruction.

Of particular interest when looking at the museums foundation and early years is a protocol from 1915, which documents the challenges encountered during the museum's establishment, the criteria for object collection, and the objectives behind collecting and presenting at that time.

Firstly, it clarifies that there was no initial plan to create such a museum. Instead, it developed organically as more objects were acquired by missionaries who grew increasingly enthusiastic about collecting. By 1911, the collection had outgrown four shelves, necessitating a move to larger rooms. The Dorsten monastery was the only place with suffficent space, providing over 200 square meters for the collection.

Secondly, the protocol attempts to explain the purpose of collecting and exhibiting these objects. While anticipating potential opposition to bringing these objects to Germany, the primary goal was not merely to document their missionary work but to preserve these objects and make them accessible to the local people. This accessibility was intended to convey the importance of the missionary mission. The collected objects served as evidence of the "pagan misery" among these cultures, which used  "idols, ritual devices, magic spells against demons, and black magic," and were regarded as morally problematic. In contrast, the collection also included items used by the missionaries to show the ways of conversions to Christianity. While the religions of these indigenous people were described as "pagan misery," the culture and work of the Christian monks were presented as a blessed culture engaged in salvific work. This was illustrated through images of the monks' activities and objects used in missionary schools, such as handicrafts crafted by the students, statistical data, and instructional materials.

Thirdly, the museum aimed to include objects that highlighted the positive aspects of diverse cultures. They collected items that they considered valuable from a European perspective while marginalising those they disagreed with. These objects mainly comprised of craftsmanship, including archaeological artefacts showcasing the rich history of various cultures, as well as paintings, silk, wood carvings, and specimens from nature.

As the collection continued to grow over time, the museum in Dorsten was tragically destroyed during the Second World War, prompting the relocation of the objects. Then, a new facility was constructed in Werl, which opened its doors in 1962, allowing the collection to expand further. In 1986, it received a substantial addition in the form of a collection from Franciscan collectors in the Netherlands, comprising approximately 3,000 objects from diverse regions and cultures.

## Franciscans missionaries in Dorsten
There are a few people named as the main givers of the first and most important objects of the early collection. While the collection from someone private has been purchased before 1913, as often had been since then, there are names of missionaries given, who contributed to it during the following years the most. The first objects from Egypt were brought by Pater Romuald Uhrich from Cairo in 1913, and were later expanded by the private collection of Dr. von Hebentanz. In the tweenties, Pater Anastasius Schollmeyer, who was both a Franciscans and an Assyrologue, got the museum the famous Cuneiform tablet collection. The collection from Palestine procured Pater Heinrich Haussle with the help of Pater Albert Rittner. During the Chinese mission, Pater Vitalis Lange sent back almost all objects containing the East-Asia collection, and Pater Remigius Gotte and Pater Cantus Hanfland colpleted it by sending back this huge Chinese coin collection. 

## Modern Rebranding of the Museum
Today, there is a concerted effort to reshape the museum's narrative, moving away from the perception of showcasing non-European cultures as false or pagan, and instead embracing them. The official flyer of the museum emphasises that the objects "offer valuable insights into the daily lives and religious practices of foreign people, spanning from ancient times to the present day.". Meanwhile, the museum's website highlights its commitment to fostering dialogue with foreign communities, religions, and cultures.

The official catalog from 1989 states that while the objects were initially used to document missionary work, they are now viewed as artefacts that shed light on foreign cultures. They serve not only to understand but also to foster tolerance by broadening our own limited worldview. To achieve this, specialists from various fields were enlisted to catalog the collection in 1986, and the presentation of objects in the museum has been enhanced to create a more engaging visitor experience.

In 1987, the museum underwent a significant transformation, culminating in its renaming to "Forum der Völker." This name change signifies an invitation to engage in dialogues with foreign cultures, people, and religions, with the aim of discovering common interests and a shared willingness to learn from one another. This pursuit is driven by the principles of justice, peace, and reverence for the divine creation, recognising that different religions may offer distinct paths leading to a common goal.

## Structure of the museum
To understand the whole “mechanism” of the museum, let’s have a short look at the structure of the exhibition and the museum generally. 

When coming in, you stand in the (currently closed) museum store, which is also the entrance. Next is a big hall already containing a few artefacts to look at. Then you can entry the exhibition, which you can follow around in a circle. 

The left entry is for the museum, and as you step in stand in the room containing the Egypt collection. It has black walls, enhancing the exhibited objects, and the centre of the room is an original mummy.

Before entering the East Asia section, there’s a comparably small shelve of cuneiform tablets, which are actually more impressive than they seem if you know what those are. The East Asian section contains many objects which stand around unprotected, and look like what you would expect from East Asian objects - shrines and religious depictions for example.

When you take a turn to the left, you’re standing in front of the Gandhara objects, which sufficient as the start of the collection, followed by Chinese and Japanese objects. Here, the walls are white, and just as in the other part of the collection, the objects are behind glass shelves.
It’s followed by two colourful rooms containing Chinese objects, which also consist of big objects such as shrines. 

The following section of Brasilia is comparably small of objects, but is enhanced by a collection of a lot of pictures from the Christian mission there and by an actual wooden hut which was put in the museum surrounded by pictures making it seem real. 

Next there are sections dedicated to African objects, some are declared as East African in an special area. Here, the exhibition seems less colourful, instead the focus is on the objects, which are divided into categories such as “power, gold and rituals”. There are also two dedicated rooms to Papua Neugin and one to only Nepal, and again I am questioning why some rooms are portrayed the way they are - colourful and playful with a lot of pictures, while others have plain white walls without any information boards.

After having walked around all these areas, you’re again standing in the entrance hall.
