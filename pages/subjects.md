## Discover Gandhara


Introduction

How does one come to dedicate an entire website, which first has to be built as well, enhanced by an endlessly seeming blog, to the digitalisation of 13 inconspicuous buddhist objects coming from the ancient region of Gandhara in Pakistan, standing in an museum in the small city of Werl in Germany which is currently closed anyways? The answer is, that a bachelor student, I, Melissa Rogalski is doing their first research project, combining researching about building their own website to portray photographed objects, and researching about Gandhara, the region which is often overlooked although of its buddhist heritage as well. 
As a result, this website contains the pictures of these now digitalised objects, and further information about the museum in Werl, an attempt to find out where these objects come from, as well as about mission museums generally as the museum in Werl is one of those kinds, and information about Gandhara, especially its buddhist history, and a lot more topics which seemed interesting relating to the collection which seemed interesting to include.. 
To reflect, I also wrote about the whole process of this project, as it took time during the entire summer semester of 2023, and now in October 2023 the result of this entire research has been published through this website.
