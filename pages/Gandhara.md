## The ancient region of Gandhara
When we begin a research project about a collection of items from Gandhara in a German mission museum, there are some important questions to consider. First, what exactly is Gandhara? Where is it located, and why haven't many of us heard about it before? Additionally, how is it related to Buddhism? These questions are intriguing, and answering them can be tricky because Gandhara has a long history filled with culture, history, and religion. Still, these questions will be answered on the following pages!

The ancient region of Gandhara, situated in present-day northwest Pakistan, held a significant place in history. Its geographical location along the Silk Road, connecting to China, South Asia, and the Mediterranean, contributed to its prosperity, complementing the agricultural plains it possessed.

This region's historical importance is underscored by its early mentions in religious texts like the Mahabharata and references by Chinese pilgrims. Its geographical boundaries were naturally defined by the Hindu Kush mountain range to the west, the Indus River to the east, the city of Peshawar and its basin opening onto the plains to the south, and to the north, the ancient region of Udyana with the Hindu Swat Valley. Beyond the Hindu Kush lay the ancient region of Nagarahara, with Bactria to its northwest. Together, these regions, including Gandhara, form Greater Gandhara. Although interconnected in their development, they maintained a degree of independence.

It's through these geographical distinctions that we categorize art from Greater Gandhara, which includes pieces from ancient Gandhara, the Swat Valley, and Afghanistan.
