# The ancient region of Gandhara
When we begin a research project about a collection of items from Gandhara in a German mission museum, there are some important questions to consider. First, what exactly is Gandhara? Where is it located, and why haven't many of us heard about it before? Additionally, how is it related to Buddhism? These questions are intriguing, and answering them can be tricky because Gandhara has a long history filled with culture, history, and religion. Still, these questions will be answered on the following pages!

The ancient region of Gandhara, situated in present-day northwest Pakistan, held a significant place in history. Its geographical location along the Silk Road, connecting to China, South Asia, and the Mediterranean, contributed to its prosperity, complementing the agricultural plains it possessed.

This region's historical importance is underscored by its early mentions in religious texts like the Mahabharata and references by Chinese pilgrims. Its geographical boundaries were naturally defined by the Hindu Kush mountain range to the west, the Indus River to the east, the city of Peshawar and its basin opening onto the plains to the south, and to the north, the ancient region of Udyana with the Hindu Swat Valley. Beyond the Hindu Kush lay the ancient region of Nagarahara, with Bactria to its northwest. Together, these regions, including Gandhara, form Greater Gandhara. Although interconnected in their development, they maintained a degree of independence.

It's through these geographical distinctions that we categorize art from Greater Gandhara, which includes pieces from ancient Gandhara, the Swat Valley, and Afghanistan.

## History of buddhism in Gandhara

To delve into Gandharan Art, it's essential to start with a brief overview of Buddhism's history in the greater Gandhara region. 

The first mention of Gandhara has already been in the 9th century B.C as mentioned in the vedic Rigveda.

In ancient Gandhara, the invasion of Alexander the Great between 331 and 327 B.C of Gandhara and Northwest India left an early influence of Buddhist art, which though only appeared 300 years later. 

Followed by the Mauryan Empire, King Ashoka in the 3. century B.C was a major supporter of buddhism, which led to the the establishment of Buddhism and its first Buddhist sites, although they initially lacked religious imagery, and six stupas have been built by him. 

Notably, the oldest written buddhist text were written in Gandhara in the 1st. century B.C in the local Gandhari language. These were later brought to China via the silk road, introducing East Asia to Buddhism, which therefore is a major event in the history of buddhism. 

The 1st century A.D saw the emergence of Buddhist sculptures, coinciding with the peak of the Kushan Dynasty from the 1st to the 3rd century A.D., who weren’t Buddhists themselves, but Zoroastrians who believed in a god similar to Siva, and were tolerant towards all religions of their conquered areas reaching up to North India, and even actively encouraged the making of Buddhist art. 

There’s evidence from this period for different buddhist schools in Gandhara, as the Sarvastivada, Mahasamghika and harmaguptaka, and there’s also material and textual scripts proving Mahayana to be practised in Gandhara, though only by a small minority since Mahayana only turned into a larger-scale movement in the 4. century.

The most prosperous era for Gandhara occurred from the 3rd to the 5th century A.D, marked by the production of iconic sculptures.

However, the 5th to 6th century A.D saw the Huns taking control of Gandhara, leading to a decline in patronage for Buddhist sacred areas. Despite this decline, older sculptures continued to be used by buddhist communities. Still, from there on Buddhism declined from the region and most buddhist sites were deserted, finalised with the conquest of Gandhara by Mahmud of Ghazni in the 11th century.

In the Afghanistan region, Buddhism thrived in tandem with Afghan communities from the 4th to the 8th century A.D. An extraordinary development occurred between 550 and 600 A.D when monumental Buddhas were constructed in Bamiyan, which was a important buddhist site until the 7th century visited by pilgrims even coming from East Asia. 

Nevertheless, the 8th to 9th century A.D marked the end of the Buddhist tradition here as well, finalised in the 14. century by the muslim invasion of the Indian subcontinent since the 12. century.


## Buddhism in Gandhara today 
Buddhism in Gandhara since then practically died out. 

In Pakistan, the countries population is muslim by 94%, while other religions such as Hindus face oppression. Therefore it’s no wonder, that in 2017 only 1884 buddhist were counted in Pakistan, with Pakistan having only one buddhist temple in Islamabad, mainly used by foreign visiting buddhists. 

Afghanistan counted 6282 buddhist in 2013, while being muslim by 99,9%. There is no buddhist temple for those, since even hindus and especially christians are heavily oppressed, even more than ever today since the taliban regime took over governmental rule.

Therefore, it is clear how besides archeological remains, buddhism as a practised religion is only a part of the past of those countries, and besides people who try to keep up the historical heritage it isn’t present today by practise, but only by Remembrance of the heritage.
