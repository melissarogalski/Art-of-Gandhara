# Proceedings of the project
This project of digitalising the small collection of objects from Gandhara from the German
Museum Forum der Völker is part of the Lehrforschungsprojekt course “Buddhist Art of Gandhara and the Reception of Buddhist Heritage in Pakistan History, Documentation, Preservation” taking place during the summer term 2023 at the Ruhr University Bochum. 

I was attending this course as a bachelor student of religious studies at CERES (Center for religious studies) under Prof. Jessie Pons and Prof. Frederik Elwert. As a student who found a huge interest of south Asian studies at CERES, but had not been in touch much with the technological aspects we would be dealing with here, I was keen to find out was this course would bring me.

## Meetings
At the beginning of the semester in April was our first meeting in an comfortable atmosphere with only five students, both bachelors and masters, and our two professors. We agreed on having meetings lasting four hours which would not take place every week but occasionally, so that we would have enough time to work on our assignments between the meetings. We even changed the timing of those meetings for me, so that I could both attend this and another important course for my history classes.

During our meeting, we always had a different topic, and with Prof. Pons we mainly learned about  the region of Gandhara, namely its history of culture, Buddhism, religions, buddhist art (which was great, because I absolutely didn’t get in touch with it before), but also for example how museums today deal with their Buddhist heritage. 

We also talked about the DiGa project, which is a project at CERES by Prof. Pons about digitalising Buddhist objects from Gandhara, which would give us an idea about how our project could look like, but besides from that it was interesting to talk about, and I found those lectures really inspiring to dive deeper into Gandhara and to find out more about it! 

Two other lessons with Prof. Elwert focused on the technological aspects of our collection, as our assignment would be to takes pictures of the objects and then to digitalise them and creating our own website. Happily, when I was absent one week Prof. Elwert recorded this class for me, which was really helpful and even necessary for when I later created my own website. 

All together we also discussed how to organise our collection, how we would have to create and handle the metadata about our objects, but also dedicated an entire meeting to drafts of our own collections, when we all gave each other feedback on what is good and what is to be improved about our projects. 
So concluded, I found our meetings well-organised by our professors and always found it interesting.

## Finding my own project 
A necessity for the project of course was also to find our own project. In the beginning I faced different problems, namely while I had the idea for a project in the beginning, which was not bad at all, I then realised that this project was not suitable for me. 

While it was said that our project really doesn’t have to do anything with Gandhara or even Buddhism at all (it was recommended to stay in the region of South Asia though), and I thought about doing a project about Buddhist objects and statues in profane surroundings in Bochum to then talk about Buddhist adaption and cultural appropriation of Buddhism, I then noticed that even if these topics are of interest generally I didn’t want to focus on them, but instead I wanted to keep closer to actual Buddhism and its history, especially because my interest for history and south Asian religions grew even bigger during my studies and with our meetings talking about Gandhara.

My other problem that was that I focused to much on different things and other courses and I wasn’t too eager about deciding for a different project. Thankfully, in the beginning of June when I was working at CERES Prof. Pons came to my office and informed me that a lecture will take upstairs in some minutes which might be of interest for me, and that was very much true. 

It was a lecture about a project going on at the museum in Werl about “Provenienceforschung“, but the lecture also was about the objects from Gandhara and arose my interest. 
Immediately after we talked to the responsible people from the museum if it would be possible for me to do this project, with the need of visiting the museum. When it was set that this would be my project for the course, I was very happy about it since it combines the topic of the controversial missionary collection with the great history of the region of Gandhara and Buddhism and buddhist art there.

## Visiting the museum 
In September, I finally got the chance to actually visit the museum to examine and take photographs of the objects I have been researching about, as because I mentioned before, the museum currently is closed. That’s why I luckily could join a group of researches from the CERES Institute, because for them the museum was able to open for once in a while.

When we went in, it was the atmosphere you would expect from a museum which has been closed for a longer period of time: the entrance hall was dark, and the museums shop which indeed had some interesting objects to sell, obviously was closed. 

I then was left alone to examine the collection of objects, and as mentioned in previous chapters, I started to notice how misleading this collection of Gandharan objects is placed, and how it seems detached from the collection and the information given about Buddhism. It also didn’t seem modern, showing how long this museum has been closed. Still, I was surprised at how interesting the museum actually is, I admit. The actual exhibition has dimmed and comfortable lighting, and you’re surrounded by very many diverse objects. 

Even though I knew that the collection from Gandhara was small, I didn’t realise how compact it would be before that. Still, I enjoyed seeing the objects in real life and how it’s presented in the museum. While some of the objects were hard to take pictures of because of the glass in front of it, it was sufficient and didn’t take much time. 

I also looked at the entire area of this collection containing mostly East Asian artefacts, and took notes used for the previous chapters. I then strolled around the rest of the unrelated exhibition a bit to capture a complete impression of the museum, and I found the diverse collection which even contained a real mummy to be really interesting. So overall, after leaving through the dark entrance door with confusing corridors leading to different rooms, I found that to be a little strange, but very interesting visit.

## Creating the website
Being exposed to the digital aspect of this course has been a real challenge to me. With GitHub, we were supposed to build our own websites to present our collections and the information about them as a kind of blog entry. 
While I was absent in the lessons when Prof. Elwert was teaching about this process, he was recording it so I would be able to watch it later, and I have to admit that I perhaps wouldn’t have been able to do so without this video! 

I watched this four hour video once, and then again trying to follow the steps to create the website. After sitting at my desk trying to do so for 10 hours, I gave up and decided to first gather more information for the blog entry, so that I wouldn’t lose motivation.

To be honest, it wasn’t that hard, it’s just that I was completely new on this topic, and that I managed to do plenty of small mistakes which were the reason the building of the website failed very many times. But I got used to it and managed to learn everything and actually had fun in the end. A small mistake was thankfully corrected by Prof. Elwert in the last meeting of our course, so then finally my website was build, and as I could now actually see it, I was able to find pictures and different configurations to change to style of my website, which also wasn’t as easy as it seems, but also was fun! 

Concluded, this task was the aspect of the project I was completely new to and which I struggled with the most, but I am glad that this was a part of the project and that I was able to work through it.

## Finding information 
As usual for a research project, I had to find out more about all the aspects in the previous chapters, such as about Buddhism, Gandhara, but also about the Werl Museum. 
While kindly Prof. Pons provided me with a range of books about Buddhism in Gandhara, Buddhist art in Gandhara, but also a book and some information paper about the collection in Werl, those I found to be very rich of information and really helpful for my information. There are also plenty of essays about decolonisation and colonial museum, but also missionaries generally to be found. 

I instead struggled a little to find more specific information about the Franciscan Monks in Germany and in Werl, especially about the missions abroad. While I got the name of the main contributing monks to the museum, I wasn’t able to get any information about them, also because of the fact that I wasn’t able to visit the archive of the museum, as mentioned before.  

And even though Ernst Majonica isn’t the most spoken politician of our era, there was plenty of literature about him - but now about his travels and collecting activities in Pakistan. I thought I found a gold mine, when I found an 800 pages diary of him - but it actually only talked about his travels to East Asia, and not South Asia. 

So with only restricted information about some aspects of this project, I tried to gather as much as I can to complete all necessary information, and actually had a lot of fun about researching all this topics - Buddhism, Gandhara, the museum and decolonisation.
