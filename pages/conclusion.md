# Conclusion
After spending so much time on this project regarding different topics, it seems hard to sum everything up. Dealing with these previously not very familiar topics has been very interesting, and sometimes challenging, but it definitely rose interest to even dive deeper into the topping, both this of Gandhara and the mission museums.

Gandhara appeared as an extremely rich of culture ancient region which deserves much better recognition, and while of course in scholar circles it a popular topic of research, it often appears as overshadowed by its neighbours as India and East Asia, which are somehow more famous for their Buddhist past, at least in the West.

The Forum der Völker has been discovered as an extremely interesting museum containing thousands of various objects. While things have to be catched up on, as the colonial past of the museum and the somehow insufficient portray of objects from colonial backgrounds, but also of the Gandharan objects, the museum currently is closed, but perhaps it’s chances for improvement will be picked up on in the future, as there is a chance for missionary and colonial museums to continue to exist without supporting colonial power structures.

As the process of the project has been discussed before, I can lastly say that despite having difficulties in the beginning and starting late, I found it very enriching to work on this project, and while doing I definitely learned a lot supporting my projects in the future.
As a result, this websites functions to keep the work up longer than the average term paper and therefore is a result which can be grasped by making all the work visible, which in the end definitely makes me proud.
